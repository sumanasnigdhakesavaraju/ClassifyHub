### Project Title: Simple Logistic Regression on Iris Dataset

## Overview:
This project explores the implementation of Simple Logistic Regression on the famous Iris dataset. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of the classification process, focusing on the Iris dataset's features and target classes.

## Prerequisites:
Ensure the following prerequisites for successful notebook execution:
- **Python Version:** 3.9 or above
- **Datasets:** Download the Iris dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris) and follow the loading steps provided in the notebook.
- **Libraries:** All required libraries are imported within the notebook.

## Steps Covered in the Notebook:
1. **Importing Required Packages:** Loading essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
2. **Loading Data:** Instructions on obtaining and loading the Iris dataset, detailing its features and target classes.
3. **Building Model:** A step-by-step guide on implementing Simple Logistic Regression for classification.
4. **Implementing Model on Data:** Executing the model on the Iris dataset to make predictions.
5. **Evaluate Model Performance:** Assessing the accuracy of the Simple Logistic Regression model.

## Simple Logistic Regression Formula:
The Simple Logistic Regression formula is expressed as:

\[ P(Y=1|X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(b_0 + b_1X)}} \]

Where:
- \( P(Y=1|X) \) is the probability that the output \( Y \) is 1 given input \( X \).
- \( b_0 \) is the intercept.
- \( b_1 \) is the coefficient of the feature \( X \).
- \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm.

## Results:
The accuracy of the Simple Logistic Regression model on the Iris dataset is close to 96%.
