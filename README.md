  Understand the basic principles and implementation of logistic regression in a binary classification setting.

- **Multiple Logistic Regression:**
  Dive into logistic regression in a multiclass classification scenario, exploring the nuances of handling multiple classes.

### Linear Discriminant Analysis
Explore Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), a method emphasizing the linear combination of features to discriminate between classes effectively.

### Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
Delve into Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), a classifier that allows for more flexible decision boundaries by considering quadratic relationships.

### Naive Bayes
Discover Naive Bayes, a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, known for its simplicity and effectiveness, particularly in text classification.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Uncover the principles of K-Nearest Neighbors, a non-parametric method relying on the proximity of data points to make classifications.
